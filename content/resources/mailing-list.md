title: Mailing List
---

The PLUG mailing list is one of the main points of interaction between PLUG members. (Another being our regular [meetings and events](/events/_index.md).) The list is for discussion of everything Linux-related and can be a good way to get help for those having trouble with Linux. Off-topic messages are tolerated in small quantities but longer threads should be moved to the [off-topic list](#offtopic). We don't look fondly upon [flaming](https://foldoc.org/flame), [trolling](https://foldoc.org/troll) or [spamming](https://foldoc.org/spam). Announcements of PLUG events are posted to the [plug-announce](#announce) list, which automagically includes subscribers of the PLUG list. Linux.conf.au Bid discussions take place in the [userconf](#userconf) list, which automagically includes subscribers of the PLUG list. Some topics come up again and again. If you're new to the list you're encouraged to [search the archives](http://lists.plug.org.au/pipermail/) (or look at recent postings) in case your questions have already been answered.

## <a name="announce">The plug-announce list</a>

The plug-announce list is a low-traffic moderated mailing list, used for announcing upcoming PLUG events. It averages around 3 or 4 messages per month. Subscribers of the main PLUG mailing list are automatically subscribed to the plug-announce list, so need not subscribe again. However, if you want to keep up with PLUG events, without the traffic from the main PLUG list, then subscribe to plug-announce. To subscribe, send an e-mail to [plug-announce-request@plug.org.au](mailto:plug-announce-request@plug.org.au) containing the word <tt>subscribe</tt> in the subject or body of the message. To leave, send a message containing <tt>unsubscribe</tt> to the same address. You can also [subscribe or unsubscribe over the web](http://lists.plug.org.au/mailman/listinfo/plug-announce). There is also [an archive](https://old.plug.org.au/archives/list/plug-announce.html) of all the past posts to the plug-announce list.

## <a name="jobs">The Jobs list</a>

We have a list for employment opportunities for those skilled in Linux and Open Source technologies - and of course for recruiters trying to find those people. Please keep descriptions clear, and do not post the same job more than once per month. You can [subscribe or unsubscribe](http://lists.plug.org.au/mailman/listinfo/jobs/) over the web.

## <a name="admin">The Admin list</a>
* [Admin subcommittee](http://lists.plug.org.au/mailman/listinfo/admin) - Running PLUG's own online infrastructure

## <a name="av">The AV list</a>
* [AV subcommittee](http://lists.plug.org.au/mailman/listinfo/av) - Audio/Video recording project

## <a name="offtopic">The off-topic list</a>

We have a separate mailing list for PLUG members to use for discussions which are not necessarily of interest to the rest of PLUG. It can be a place to rant and rave, debate pedantic points of language, discuss non-Linux-related news or even argue about the merits of capitalism. Generally, conversations which drift too far from any relevance to Linux move to the off-topic list when people start complaining. To join it, send an e-mail to [off-topic-request@plug.org.au](mailto:off-topic-request@plug.org.au) containing the word <tt>subscribe</tt> in the subject or body of the message. To leave, send a message containing <tt>unsubscribe</tt> to the same address. You can post to it by sending messages to [off-topic@plug.org.au](mailto:off-topic@plug.org.au). You can also [subscribe or unsubscribe over the web](http://lists.plug.org.au/mailman/listinfo/off-topic). There is also [an archive](https://old.plug.org.au/archives/list/plug-off-topic.html) of all the past posts to the off-topic list.

## <a name="userconf">The userconf list</a>

We have a separate mailing list for PLUG members to use for discussions about the Linux.conf.au Bid. To join it, send an e-mail to [userconf-request@plug.org.au](mailto:userconf-request@plug.org.au) containing the word <tt>subscribe</tt> in the subject or body of the message. To leave, send a message containing <tt>unsubscribe</tt> to the same address. You can post to it by sending messages to [userconf@plug.org.au](mailto:userconf@plug.org.au). You can also [subscribe or unsubscribe over the web](http://lists.plug.org.au/mailman/listinfo/userconf).
