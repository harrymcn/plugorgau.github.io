Description:James Henstridge on GitHub Actions.

GH Actions is a continuous integration system that can be used for
everything from building and testing code as it is checked in to
automatically responding to bug reports.

The talk will cover the basics of how to use the system, along with an
overview of how to extend it with your own actions.
