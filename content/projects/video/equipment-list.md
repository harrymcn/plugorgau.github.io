The equipment we are aiming to use in most places is as generic, affordable and commodity as possible. No component should be subject to vendor lock-in.

Cameras: any camera capable of delivering live DV rames, typically over firewire

PCs: any PC running Linux with a firewire capture card.

Mics: generic wireless lapel mics with standard connections;: either 3.5 mm jack, or potentially XLR.

Mixer: generic multi channel audio mixer
