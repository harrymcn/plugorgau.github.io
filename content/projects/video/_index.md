title: Video Streaming Project
---

The Video Streaming Project is an effort to build a multi-source streaming video solution, suitable for recording lecture style presentations, using Open Source Software and commodity hardware.

We aim to document the equipment and issues experienced, and build a Bill Of Materials to show what this costs. The goal is to produce videos streamed live online, and have the recorded stream available after transmission on-demand, with ZERO manual post production.

We aim to make the format of the content as engaging as possible, regardless of the content of the presentation.

This project leverages excellent resources and presentations on the subject already available.
