PLUG is looking for a new Logo.

We have entries so far from Peter Taekema (Great Southern Computer Services-http://gscomputers.com.au ) and Jason Nicholls. Both have earned themselves a year's membership to PLUG (which is worth double as of 1 July 2011!).

One of the desired features of our new logo is to have it in SVG (vector) format if possible, so if anyone wants to have a play with any of the submitted entries (or indeed a fresh entry) then you will still be eligible for the free membership (or renewal).  For those interested, there is an SVG version of Tux at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Tux.svg  The GIMP original of Peter's .png files is available on request (about 18mb) if anyone wants it.

Deadline for fresh entries was Friday 1 July 2011.
