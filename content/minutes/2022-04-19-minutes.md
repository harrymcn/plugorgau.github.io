      * Unusually smooth setup:
        * BBB briefing for presenter
        * wired uplink working and available, presenter laptop on wifi, no network glitches
        * presenter head-mounted mike -> audio mixer, audience handheld mike available
          * XLR extension escaped to general audio box

        * presenter slides captured by BBB

          * Screenshare video is of low quality: lots of transition animations in presenter's demo that the 5 fps recording doesn't keep up with.
            * could tweak that setting as needed: `deskshare_output_framerate: 30` fps instead of the default 5
            * surprise dead, not-charging, battery in avmaster (disappointing as it's been recently replaced)

## 5. General Business & Matters Arising
* ACTION: Event promotion: team effort - see previous minutes for details, e.g. https://github.com/plugorgau/plugorgau.github.io/blob/master/content/minutes/2021-05-18-minutes.md#5-general-business--matters-arising
  * Paul or Peter will update all events in meetup and sync with Google calendar

* ACTION: Peter: Update PLUG addresses + update the address associated with the ABN (via ATO.gov.au?), ASIC (N.B. Benjamin's new address)
  * Who/what/where to contact next?
    * https://connectonline.asic.gov.au/ , "Perth Linux User Group" ABN 58233849580
  * Also AWS has old address: volunteer to fix?

* Subcommittee: Review of PLUG mailing lists Discuss with mailing list members. Reinstate plug-announce and ensure all active members are on it to enable us to meet legal requirements for announcing AGM. This would require regular updates as members join/drop out. Margaret to investigate using UGMM for official announcements - script written to extract email addresses of all current and overdue members, used for official announcement of AGM and call for nominations.

* Can we create a [PayID](https://payid.com.au/) for the PLUG bank account? This would be less error prone than typing the BSB + account number. We could create PayIDs for committee email address and maybe also ABN.
    * http://lists.plug.org.au/mailman/private/committee/2021-June/010370.html
    * ACTION: Peter to visit branch and try setting up committee address as payid (also ABN?)

* Meetup - can we get renewal emails sent to committee@plug.org.au, and use PLUG debit card to pay?
    * Discuss for 10 minutes at next AV hack session
* rsync.net - also should be paid via debit card if possible, due April
  * ACTION: Benjamin: Create reimbursement transaction
* aws.amazon.com
  * Bill due?
* Plan is for PLUG to take over digitalocean.com bill directly

## 6. New General Business
* aws.amazon.com
  * ACTION: Nick: Contact Developer Marketing Manager for an event speaker+swag

## 7. Meeting closed by Patrick at 21:17
