    * Between $200 and $300 approximate cost
    * Goal is to create automated tools to allow us to migrate enough away from Power (old server) to allow us to turn off Power most of the time (estimates @ 95% at this stage) and eventually to be removed and deprecated at the conclusion of the UGMM modernization work
