<p>The project consists of three &ldquo;layers&rdquo;:</p>
<ul>
<li>The network hardware, a simple router which consumes WiFi, Ethernet or 4G/5G at a location and provides it to AV equipment (&ldquo;PLUG-Members&rdquo; WiFi network) and, optionally, PLUG guests (&ldquo;PLUG&rdquo; WiFi network)</li>
<li>The AV equipment, consisting of a laptop (whether PLUG-provided, or presenter-provided) with a webcam for capturing the presenter + HDMI output for presenting on a TV screen or projector at a venue.</li>
<li>Archiver equipment (optional), consisting of one or more devices at the venue capturing video and audio. Alternatively, this takes the form of BigBlueButton recording, which is currently the preferred method.</li>
</ul>
<p>Each layer is dependent on the layer above (except the network hardware, which is dependent on having some sort of internet connection to connect to).</p>
